# brpcs_heur_exact

An implementation of the ALNS meta heuristic for the bicycle repositioning problem with charging stations, and an exact branch & cut method.

## Building the code in Linux

1. Clone the repository and add executable permission to a script that will call CMake for you:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lucasparada20/brpcs_heur.git
cd brpcs_heur
chmod u+x cmake_script_heur.sh
```
2. Build the code by typing:

```bash
./cmake_script_heur.sh
```

if you want to debug or use valgrind, just type:

```bash
./cmake_script_heur.sh debug
```

```bash
./cmake_script_heur.sh valgrind
```

Alternatively, inside the directory `src_heur`, you will also find a `Makefile` that can build the code by typing:

```bash
(cd src_heur && make) # Assuming you are in the brpcs_heur directory
```

3. The compiler needs an absolute path to your installed Cplex library. To provide the path, go into src_heur/CMakeLists.txt and edit the following line:

```cmake
set(CPLEX_DIR "/some/path/to/Cplex")
```

or, if you are building with the provided Makefile, go into src_heur/Makefile and edit the following line:

```Makefile
# CPLEX directory
CPLEX_DIR = /some/path/to/Cplex
```

To call the executable, the script `run_heur.sh` contains all the shell commands you need, for example:

```bash
build/exec_heur instance_file=instances/quebec167_20_CS.txt construction_heuristic=SEQ max_route_distance=60
```

Lastly, this code will store results and output files in a directory named `results`. Therefore, ensure that you create it within the `brpcs_heur` directory first.

## Bicycle Sharing System (BSS) Data

The data used to build the instance is the so-called station status and information `.json` files, which are publicly available in several real-life systems worldwide. It can be downloaded from this Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-X09VmiW9i9npeOmFV78BVJmqWTF2QiF/view?usp=sharing). There are over two months of data available in the link, presented in daily JSON files.

The link also has some interesting Unix shell scripts that will update and scrub the data; therefore, I recommend downloading the data and unzipping it into the `brpcs_heur` directory.

### Updating the BSS data

The following script will retrieve the snapshot `station_information` and `station_status` files and store them in the respective directories for the cities of the respective BSS.

```bash
./updateData.sh
```

### Current available bicycles

The following script will count the current number of bicycles in the systems, as well as compute the average and standard deviations of the historical data available.

```bash
./countBikes.sh
```

To run this script, you will need `jq`, a JSON command line processor. It can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

## Instance Generator

Besides the data in the Google Drive link, the generator requires the following command to be compiled, assuming that you unzipped the Google Drive link into `brpcs_heur/data_brpcs`:

```bash
(cd generator && g++ -O3 main.cpp RandomNumbers.cpp -o gen)
```

To call the executable of the generator, the following is the format of the command line required:

```bash
generator/gen uncharged_percentage=0.20 city_name=quebec seed=19900316 
```

Here, `uncharged_percentage` is the sought percentage of electrically uncharged bikes in the network for the total amount of bikes, and `seed` is to initialize the pseudo-random number generator. 

Once you enter the sample command, the generator will create one instance for the BSS in Qu√©bec, Canada. This instance will include the actual locations of the bike stations throughout the city, along with the average number of bicycles intended to be available at each station. The latter quantities are referred to as the target levels. Additionally, it will provide the most recent initial quantities of bicycles currently available at these locations.
